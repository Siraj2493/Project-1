Project Title: Energy usage in various population densities and weather

Jerome Pelham, Shane Gary, Kannan Sekkappan, Sirajuddin Pirzada

Project Description/Outline - We will pick 6 locations (northern city, southern city, northern suburb, southern suburb, northern rural, southern rural) that have weather and energy usage data for at least 1 year.  We will evaluate how population density and weather data impact energy usage.

What is the correlation between energy usage, climate, and density?

Dataset to Be Used:
US Census - population/population density
energy data - https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption#AEP_hourly.csv or similiar
NOAA - weather API
